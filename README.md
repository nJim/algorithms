# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repo chronicles my time exploring algorithms and data structures to level up as a software engineer. These are fundamental concepts that everyone studies in their career but too often stop after only acquiring a few tools in their toolkit. The data in our world is getting larger and more complicated, and modern algorithms are becoming as valuable as the software they power. Both academic and practical knowledge in this space is an essential part of being a senior engineer; or as Niklaus Wirth put it about 50 years ago: Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs.

## Data Structures

Data Structures organize and store data in computers in such a way that we can perform operations on the data more efficiently. Primitive data structures are simple data types (int, char, float, double, and pointers) that may hold a single value. Where more complex data structures may store data in linear types (array, list, and queue) or non-liner types (trees and graphs.)

Common operations that can be performed on the data structures are: search, sort, insert, update, and delete. Example data structures in the repository will include a variety methods that stretch across these operations.

- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queues
- Hash
- Tree
- Heep
- Graph
